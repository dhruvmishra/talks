## Workshops

### ES6/2016

- [The Strange Loop 2016](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/2016/es6-and-beyond.html): [video](https://youtu.be/dnF-wrw0Q_w)
- [Connect.JS 2016](http://connect-js.com/)

> The EcmaScript standard is now on a yearly release cycle. With ES6 complete and ES2016 almost ratified, we have a ton of awesome new features to use in our daily software development. In this training, we'll learn about the features you're likely to use and benefit from on a day-to-day basis. In the afternoon, we'll take an existing application and update it to leverage these features using with modern tools like Babel. My goal is that after this training, you'll be able to go back to your projects and add these tools so you can write ES.next code today.
>
> This is a very hands-on training and you'll need to make sure that you're machine is set up. Please ensure that you have git, Node, npm, and a text editor / IDE installed on your machine. With that, you'll be ready to rock and roll. Feel free to hit me up on twitter if you have any questions.

### React + AVA = ❤️

PayPal internal workshop.

[slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/react-ava) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-ava) | [recording](https://youtu.be/UmDNx06472I)

Here's the description for the original event when I gave this at PayPal:

> Hey everyone! I hope you're excited about testing!
> If you're curious about what ava is, check out http://npm.im/ava
> If you're curious about testing in React, check out https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html
> 
> We'll be using a common repo to do the workshop. You can find it here: https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-ava-workshop 
> 
> The format of the workshop will be:
> - I give a brief intro to concepts
> - You use those concepts to accomplish a task
> - Repeat
> 
> Things you'll need:
> - Your laptop
> - git
> - node (preferably a recent version, but 0.10.x should hopefully work fine)
> - npm (preferably 3.x, but 2.x should hopefully work fine)


### Webpack Workshop

PayPal internal conference

[slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/webpack-workshop) | [TodoMVC repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/require-to-webpack-todomvc) | [recording](https://youtu.be/NEJyIBwo-ik)

> This is similar to the second half of the ES6 Workshop except instead of the VanillaJS TodoMVC app I use the Backbone + Require.js version (because many of the developers at PayPal have apps written like that).

### ES6 Workshop

[MidwestJS 2015](http://midwestjs.com/)

[slides](https://slides.com/kentcdodds/es6-workshop) | [workshop](https://github.com/kentcdodds/es6-workshop) | [TodoMVC repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/es6-todomvc) | [video 1](https://youtu.be/aeY6ctvsurs) | [video 2](https://youtu.be/a96r7Tjf0Ps)

Abstract:

> JavaScript is tons of fun to program in. But it only gets better with the next iteration on the language! Super sad that you have to support ES5 browsers until the end of time? Worry no more! With modern tools, you can start coding ES6 right now. Come to this training to learn how to set this up in your own project and start developing applications of the future today! The goal of this course is to get you thinking with the mind of an ES6 JavaScripter and that you’ll take that knowledge home to your projects to level-up your development. You wont be able to help yourself when we’re done :-)

Abstract:

> AngularJS is one of the most popular frontend frameworks out there right now. If you haven't tried it yet, prepare to be amazed! Here's what we'll cover: 
> 
> 1. Templates/Expressions - Your View
> 2. Module - Your app's namespace
> 3. Directives - DOM Interface
> 4. Filters - Display utils
> 5. Scope - What on earth is this thing!?
> 6. Controllers - The View Model
> 7. Services - Common utilities
> 8. Working with third-party modules
> 9. Routing - Single Page App with state in the URL
> 10. Firebase & AngularFire - A full web application with no server setup required!
>
> We'll be following through a repository hosted on GitHub. There's a branch for each concept, so you can play around with the code and then catch right back up with the next branch. So come on, and let's learn AngularJS!
